### Welcome dear friend!

Hi, my name is _@flizzyflo_ and I am a self-taught (and still self-teaching) programming interested guy from germany.
I’m fascinated by the creative power of programming, thus I am exited to learn and enable myself to create anything I like to.
Currently, I am programming mostly with Python and learning Java, and did a littlebit in Pascal as well. I would still consider myself a beginner, even though I learn a lot about OOP principles and so on now.
I am excited to get feedback for my projects, improve myself and move along the way step-by-step, together with the worldwide programming community.

Currently, I am very interested in implementing sort algorithms and visualize them as well - either in Java or python.
