Hi, my name is @flizzyflo and I am a self-taught (and still self-teaching) programming interested guy from germany.
I’m fascinated by the creative power of programming, thus I am exited to learn and enable myself to create anything I like to.
Currently, I am programming mostly with Python and Java, and did a littlebit in Pascal as well.
I am excited to get feedback for my projects, improve myself and move along the way step-by-step, together with the worldwide programming community.
