- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @flizzyflo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming with Python and learning about programming and computer science in general. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the foundations of programming, mostly with Python, and a littlebit of Pascal.
      I do not have a computer science degree, I am totally self-learning everything, having a lot of fun! :)
