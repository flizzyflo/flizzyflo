# Welcome dear friend!

My name is _@flizzyflo_ and I am a self-taught (and still self-teaching) programming interested guy from germany.
I’m fascinated by the creative power of programming, thus I am exited to learn and enable myself to create anything I like to.
Currently, I am programming with Python. I did some Java in the past as well as a littlebit in Pascal. I would still consider myself a beginner, even though I learn a lot about OOP principles and so on now. Futhermore, I am learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JS now.

I am excited to get feedback for my projects, improve myself and move along the way step-by-step, together with the worldwide programming community.
